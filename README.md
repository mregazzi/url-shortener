#PROJECY GOAL
##This is a pure learning project. The main goal is to learn AI-assisted cloud development while creating a simple yet useful application, still applying some XP practices such as TDD, small release, continuous integration, refactoring and simple design (if able). I will pair with ChatGPT configured in  Study Mode, no agent or AI assistant running direct in the IDE (Goland).
#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
##The projecy will consist of an application that will offer a URL shortener function, written in Go, with user and password access and optionally with MFA. The data will be stored in Mongo DB, and telemetry will be generated using Grafana and Prometheus.
I'll first work locally using Docker Compose and then deploy to Proxmox in my home-lab, running Kubernetes lightweight or microk8s (to be defined. The development, build, test, and deployment chain must be as automated as possible.
